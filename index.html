        <p>India's struggle for independence was marked by a series of pivotal events and tireless efforts by numerous leaders. Beginning with the First War of Independence in 1857, the movement gained momentum through the formation of the Indian National Congress and subsequent mass mobilizations. Key events included the Non-Cooperation Movement led by Mahatma Gandhi, the Quit India Movement of 1942, and revolutionary activities spearheaded by figures like Bhagat Singh and Subhas Chandra Bose. The culmination of these efforts led to the end of British colonial rule and the partition of India and Pakistan. August 15, 1947, stands as a monumental day, symbolizing the end of colonial oppression and the birth of a free, sovereign nation committed to democracy and justice.</p>
